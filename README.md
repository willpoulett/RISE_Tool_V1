# RISE Tool

The Risk Informed Synthetic Embedding (RISE) tool uses the final hidden layer activations of synthetic images to explore the behaviour

All images were generated from a risk log generated by an AI assurer. Additional risks were found using LLama3.1 8B, and then turned into image prompts. Dall-E3 was used to generate synthetic images using these image prompts. 

In order to use the tool, use the `RISE_tool.ipynb` file. 

## Using the RISE tool in Github Codespaces:

- Add a branch to this repo. You can do this by going to [here](https://github.com/willpoulett/RISE_Tool_V1/branches) and clicking `New branch`. Name the branch something unique.

- Within this branch open a github codespace. You can do this by pressing (`.`). Alternatively, click the green `Code` button, and select 'Create a Codespace`

- If you want to use the RISE tool WITH labels:

    Within your Codespace, navigate to `RISE WITH Labels.ipynb`.

    If you want to use the RISE tool WITHOUT labels:

    Within your Codespace, navigate to `RISE WITHOUT Labels.ipynb`.

    If neither of these work, naviagte to `RISE_tool.ipynb` and connect to a Kernal. Run all the commands. An interactive tool will appear.

## Using the RISE Tool

Above is an example useage of the RISE tool.

You can:

- Highlight multiple images and view them all.
- Hover over images.
- Change the projection of the images.
- OPTIONAL: You can add labels inside the `RISE_tool.ipynb` notebook.
