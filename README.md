# RISE Tool

The Risk Informed Synthetic Embedding (RISE) tool uses the final hidden layer activations of synthetic images to explore the behavior

All images were generated from a risk log generated by an AI assurer. Additional risks were found using LLama3.1 8B, and then turned into image prompts. Dall-E3 was used to generate synthetic images using these image prompts. 

In order to use the tool, use the `RISE_tool.ipynb` file.

## Using the RISE tool in Github Codespaces:

- Add a branch to this repo. Name the branch something unique.

- Within this branch open a github codespace. You can do this by pressing (`.`). Alternatively, click the green `Code` button, and select 'Create a Codespace`

- If you want to use the RISE tool WITH labels:

    Within your Codespace, navigate to `RISE WITH Labels.ipynb`.

    If you want to use the RISE tool WITHOUT labels:

    Within your Codespace, navigate to `RISE WITHOUT Labels.ipynb`.

    If neither of these work, naviagte to `RISE_tool.ipynb` and connect to a Kernal. Run all the commands. An interactive tool will appear.

## Using the RISE Tool

Above is an example usage of the RISE tool.

You can:

- Highlight multiple images and view them all.
- Hover over images.
- Change the projection of the images.
- OPTIONAL: You can add labels inside the `RISE_tool.ipynb` notebook.

# Label Tool

Within this repo in the `labelling` folder is the code used for creating the label tool we used ot gather labels of our images. you 

1 - Add a branch to this repo. Name the branch something unique.

2 - Within this branch open a github codespace. You can do this by pressing `.`

3 - Within your codespace, navigate to `LABEL TOOL.ipynb` and connect to a codespace kernal.

4 - Run the cells in the `LABEL TOOL.ipynb` notebook. You will need a `USER_ID` number. This is either a 0 or a 1.

5 - A widget will appear which allows you to label each image shown on screen. To regularly save your work by click the `Save / Commit` button. This will automatically commit your annotations to your branch. Commiting has been turned off in this repo, however, the code is available.
