# RISE Tool

The Risk Informed Synthetic Embedding (RISE) tool uses the final hidden layer activations of synthetic images to explore the behaviour

All images were generated from a risk log generated by an AI assurer. Additional risks were found using LLama3.1 8B, and then turned into image prompts. Dall-E3 was used to generate synthetic images using these image prompts. 

In order to use the tool, use the RISE_tool.ipynb file.
